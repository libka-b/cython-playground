# cython-playground
Playground for testing out and dumping my cython experiments

## Intentions

I want to use this repository to keep here pieces of cython code to have a 
reference place to look how to write these. Do not expect high code quality 
in here it will most likely be bunch of files in each of the subdirectories.

Should you find any of it useful, use it at your will.
